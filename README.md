Introduction
======================

- QNTU (Quanta Network Token Utility) is a breakthrough cryptocurrency token. By design, the total quantity of QNTU currently and permanently amounts to 120 billion tokens. QNTU is held by Quanta PLC, a privately held blockchain company headquartered in Douglas, Isle of Man. QNTU is governed by the globally respected and stringent Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA).
- Quanta is not selling QNTU tokens under any circumstances. Tokens are distributed based on a loyalty scheme determined by Quanta. The tokens are tradable as they consist of an ERC-20 Ethereum token. Token holders will be able to exchange QNTU for major cryptocurrencies. First listing of QNTU is in one of the blockchain industry's most well-known and trusted Europe-based exchange.

Token Concept
======================

The QNTU token functions as a pledge that community members must “put up” before they may begin participation. In the event that the participant breaches the terms of use laid out by Quanta, the pledge made in QNTU is forfeited to the Quanta Foundation.

- Community participants required to make a QNTU pledge in order to participate:
  - RANDAO Players: The QNTU pledge is deposited prior to the KYC procedure. 
  - Affiliate Marketers: The QNTU pledge raises the affiliate marketer to a level above that of a bounty participant. The QNTU pledge means the affiliate marketer will receive a commission in the currency used in the lottery (ETH).

- Non-community participants required to make a QNTU pledge in order to participate: 
  - White Label Licensees: The QNTU pledge is a mechanism by which whitelabel businesses can be kept in check. If the terms of use are breached and the pledge lost by the white label licensee, that lottery business can no longer function. 
  - Experts and Consultants: The QNTU pledge ensures that regional legal, business, and advertising experts devote themselves to compliance with local laws, as well as to honest practices in general.
